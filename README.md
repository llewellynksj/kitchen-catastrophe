## Design
### **Colour Scheme**
This website uses primarily a palette of green colours to reflect a fresh, clean, foodie feel. The palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

![Image of colour palette from Coolors.co]()

<br>

### **Typography**
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to source the font styles used throughout the website:
- Andika: Used for the main body of website
- Permanant Marker: Used for the game title only

Andika was chosen as the primary font as it's in keeping with the sense of fun and games.
Permanant Marker was chosen as it feels in keeping with the title itself; 'Kitchen Catastrophe'. It gives a sense of wildness.

Both were also chosen to ensure maximum accessibility.

<br>

### **Imagery**


Icons used on the homepage and support page were imported through [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

<br>

### **Wireframes**
To create the wireframes I used the [Balsamiq Wireframing Software](https://balsamiq.com/).
